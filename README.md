# Embapeh

This is **Project Embapeh**, a simple Remote Controlled Arduino-based Soccer-bot. This short project was part of the 2025 edition of **The Forge**, an annual Hardware Hackathon organized by The Factory at McGill University.

The bot is operated by an Arduino Uno, and controlled by two joysticks mounted to a 3D-printed controller handle.

## Controlling Embapeh is simple:

- each joystick controls its own wheel:
- to move **forward**, both joysticks are pushed forward
- to turn **clockwise**, the left joystick is pushed forward while the right joystick is pushed back
- to turn **counter-clockwise**, vice-versa

- this control scheme allows for maximum maneuvaribility

## Extra features

- Embapeh also features a **Focus** mode: by pressing on the left joystick, the speed of the bot is reduced to allow precise movement
- Embapeh also features a **Bunter**: by clicking the right joystick, small bunter is extended to provide (little to no) kicking power!
